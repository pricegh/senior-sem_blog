        Best in-class <br />
        <br />
        My Computer Science education has been a big mix of anxiety-inducing,
        stressful assignments (or classes as a whole), and fun, engaging
        courses. Usually this comes down to the professors teaching it, but the
        course topics themselves can kind of give you an expectation of that
        being the case. While I have had many fun Computer Science classes, I'd
        say my best experience came from one of the most stressful, and that is
        due to the resulting relief and pride, along with great improvement in
        my programming skills. I'm talking about the main Y86 simulator lab for
        Computer Systems I. In the beginning, I was scared of being
        "left-behind" or in constant catch-up mode due to my inexperience with
        C++ and assembly. The labs were a struggle, but I grinded them out and
        constantly studied the code and Y86 assembly. By the end, I had
        transformed from a complete beginner at both C++ and the assembly
        language to someone with at least some confidence in my ability, and the
        acknowledgement of that was probably my "best" in-class experience

        There is not a specific event that I can think of when it comes to being
        the "best" experience, but I think over the duration of the past few
        months especially have made me proud for being consistent when it comes
        to my learning. I am not 100% certain that I will be doing web
        development as my career over the long run, but I decided that was the
        path I wanted to take for now at least. So, especially over the last few
        months, I spent a lot of my free time learning mostly JavaScript. I
        started with being confused about basic HTML last July and now I am
        working with React, which is a more advanced JavaScript library, so the
        continual effort and improvement collectively is my best/favorite
        experience
